     <p>Hello, my name is Zoë Barsam-Cummings, and I am a senior at the Austin Waldorf School. I am interested in the study of computer science, despite the prominent gender bias in the field. To further my studies in computer science and work to end the gender biases in the field, I have participated in a couple computer science programs that actively work to make the field more diverse, including Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program and Tufts Summer Immersion Program: Coding 101. To any future programmers interested in computer science and making a change in the field, I would recommend participating in courses such as the ones I attended which combine computer science and social justice in their courses. Please feel free to contact me for more information about my work in the computer science and social justice and my experience in the wonderful programs. My email address is zrbcummings@gmail.com and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zoebarsamcummings/">My Instagram account</p>
